    "description": "In A Game of Thrones (1996), Tyrion is introduced as the third and youngest child of wealthy and powerful Tywin Lannister, the former Hand of the King. Tyrion's elder sister Cersei is the Queen of Westeros by virtue of her marriage to King Robert Baratheon, and Cersei's male twin Jaime is one of the Kingsguard, the royal security detail. Described as an ugly ('for all the world like a gargoyle'), malformed dwarf with mismatched green and black eyes, Tyrion possesses the pale blond hair of a Lannister but has a complicated relationship with the rest of them.",
